# Hiragana

The first content you'll learn with Japanly is Hiragana.

## Introduction

Hiragana is a Japanese syllabary mainly used for ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiragana)):

- Words' suffixes, like inflecting verbs and adjectives
- Japanese particles
- Japanese words
- Furigana

We'll see each of those use cases in more detail in the future, but the very first step for learning Japanese with Japanly is memorizing all the Hiragana.
